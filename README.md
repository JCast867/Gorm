# Gorm Generics API
Better documentation for the Gorm Generics API.

## Reason
The reason why I'm doing this is so other's can have a better understanding of the documentation and not struggle so much like I've been. I came from the Django community where the documentation is great. Ever since I've been using Go, Gin, and Gorm, I've been trying to learn through reading the documentation but I find the Gorm documentation lacking consistently.

The official Gorm website recommends using the Generics API instead of the Traditional API. So I've been doing that. But as I was reading through it, I would find so many incorrect information that was described. I know it was incorrect because I would do something the way the documenation tells me and I would get errors because of it (I was on the latest version of Gorm).

I'm hoping this helps others who are also struggling with the Gorm Generics API and clearifies things :)
